## Features
- Display list of patients with their basic information
- Show diagnosis history and lab results for each patient
- Provide detailed information about each patient

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Express.js (for server-side code)

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download File.

2. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables.
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```plaintext
    USER=<your_username>
    PASSWORD=<your_password>
    ```
   Replace `<your_username>` and `<your_password>` with your credentials for authentication.

4. Start the server.
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Additional Notes
- The server runs on port 3000 by default. You can change the port in the `server.js` file if needed.
- Ensure that the server is running while using the application, as it relies on server-side data fetching.
